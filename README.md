Purpose: Using LLM to assist with food choices

Method: Narrative conversion.  

Input: Human-computer exchange from another AI tool.  Copilot analyzes input to produce an output.  The input is a discussion of food intake.  

Output: Extract side by side the original desired meal and the eventually consumed meal following the discussion within.

Copilot instructions:
Given an input of narrative descriptions of what I planned to eat and what I actually ate, in natural language, produce the following output:
For each meal on each day, a markdown table capturing: Date; Meal (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack); Nutrient (Calories, Sugar, Carbohydrates, etc.); Desired Meal value (g); Consumed Meal value (g); Desired Meal Detail (free text); Consumed Meal Detail (free text)
File Structure: Each day is logged in a separate markdown file named YYYY-MM-DD.md. A daily file contains tables (one per meal) with a row for each nutrient.
I will input a file structure to mimic, followed by 3 input files for 7/7/25, 7/8/25, and 7/9/25.  Follow the input structure exactly, including the elimination of hashtags and pipes.

Are you ready for the 1st file (structure?)
