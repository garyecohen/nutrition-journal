🧠 Health Condition Snapshot (with higher cherry portion)
Condition Impact
Pre-diabetes ⚠️ Higher natural sugar load—still okay because fiber and yogurt protein help moderate blood glucose, but this is your sugar ceiling for the morning
High cholesterol ✅ Still excellent—no saturated fat, and cherries offer anti-inflammatory, vascular-supporting nutrients
High blood pressure ✅ Potassium-rich, zero sodium—great for BP
Gout ✅ Cherries are gout-friendly, even in larger amounts—they’re shown to reduce uric acid levels

⸻

🍽️ Suggestions

If you’re satisfied with this amount and don’t feel hungry mid-morning, no issue. But if you want it more filling and balanced next time:

Optional Enhancements (without spiking sugar):
• 1 tbsp chia seeds or flax meal → more fiber and fat balance
• 5–6 walnut halves → improves satiety, adds heart-healthy fat
• 1–2 tbsp low-sugar granola for crunch

✅ Final Word

This breakfast leans a little fruit-heavy but is still nutrient-dense, fiber-rich, and metabolically friendly—especially since it’s paired with high-protein, fat-free yogurt. It also sets a great tone for a lighter-sodium, vegetable-rich day ahead.

Let me know when you’re planning your next snack or lunch—I can keep building your day for balance and energy.
