Nutrition Log Automation Guide
Scenario Summary
This project tracks and compares desired versus consumed meals and nutrients on a daily basis.

Input: Narrative descriptions of what you planned to eat and what you actually ate, in natural language.
Output: For each meal on each day, a markdown table capturing:
Date
Meal (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snack)
Nutrient (Calories, Sugar, Carbohydrates, etc.)
Desired Meal value (g)
Consumed Meal value (g)
Desired Meal Detail (free text)
Consumed Meal Detail (free text)
File Structure: Each day is logged in a separate markdown file named YYYY-MM-DD.md.
A daily file contains tables (one per meal) with a row for each nutrient.
Why:
This structure supports manual entry now, and is designed for easy automation and data analysis later.

Example Table
Date	Meal	Nutrient	Desired Meal (g)	Consumed Meal (g)	Desired Meal Detail	Consumed Meal Detail
2025-06-21	Breakfast	Calories	450	290	Hazelnut Latte (grande, whole milk, full syrup), oatmeal...	Drip coffee with nonfat milk, oatmeal, blueberries
Step-by-Step Automation with GitHub
1. Manual Logging (Current)
For each day, create a new file: YYYY-MM-DD.md
For each meal, fill in a markdown table as above.
Tables may be produced with the help of Copilot Chat from narrative text.
2. Automation Plan (Future)
a. Parsing and Data Extraction
Write a script (Python, JavaScript, etc.) to:
Loop through all YYYY-MM-DD.md files in the repo.
Parse each markdown table, extracting data into a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON, dataframe).
b. Narrative Input to Table Conversion
(Optional, advanced) Use Copilot or an LLM to:
Accept narrative text about meals.
Automatically generate the markdown table for each meal (matching the above format).
Insert the table into the correct daily markdown file.
c. Reporting/Analysis
Aggregate data across multiple days/files.
Generate summary statistics, trends (e.g., average daily calories), or charts.
Optionally, create summary markdown files or visualizations.
d. Automation with GitHub Actions (Optional)
Use GitHub Actions to run scripts automatically:
On push, new meal entries could be parsed, validated, or summarized.
Reports could be regenerated and committed to the repo.
3. File and Data Structure Reference
Each daily file: YYYY-MM-DD.md

Contains meal sections (Breakfast, Lunch, etc.).
Each section = a table, one row per nutrient, columns as above.
No global log needed, but you may create an index in README.md if helpful.

Next Steps
Continue daily manual logging while you develop automation.
When ready, use this guide and the markdown schema as a reference for scripting and automation.
