Condition Fit? Notes
Fatty liver ⚠️ Higher in saturated fat — okay occasionally, especially if rest of day is light
Pre-diabetes ✅ Excellent protein/fat balance; low in carbs
High cholesterol ⚠️ One-off is fine, but regular full-fat cheese + bacon + egg = build-up risk
High blood pressure ⚠️ Sodium is on the higher side
Gout ✅ Safe — bacon is small enough amount

⸻

✅ Why It’s Still Fine:
• You’ve had very few indulgent meals this week
• You’ve included vegetables, fiber, and good fats all day
